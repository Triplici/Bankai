-- The Bankai Guild API for other addons (1.2.4, Daniel: an API inside the addon "for anyone to integrate
-- with what can be integrated, with what the permissions allow", each seeing only what that player
-- sees; his worry, someone using it to mine data). docs/API.md is its page for addon authors.
--
-- What it is, and what it never is:
--   - Read-only ordinary data. Its getters send no chat line, decree, whisper or other message and
--     change no Bankai Guild data. Network actions are separately feature-detected: the request-bound
--     player-sighting search is a verified operator's explicit Start/Cancel, or a
--     bounded rotation while a visible session the operator explicitly started remains on, with
--     the observer consent, short life, audience and last-seen semantics below; the bounded
--     profile-presentation session is host-owned, self-only and fixed-style. A registered addon
--     may also contribute one page to the Bankai Guild window; Bankai Guild still owns its lifecycle.
--     1.4.0 (the Board's groups, "groups.manage"): the player's own listing acted on as the Board's
--     own buttons do (an applicant or a flag's player invited by the game's invite, an applicant
--     declined, a member's role set, the listing lowered), and Bankai Guild's own card, composer and
--     flag dialog opened, where he posts and applies himself: never a listing posted, an
--     application sent or a word written for him. And "ui.board-groups": one companion panel in
--     place of the Board's Your group, an BankaiGuild-owned frame the player can switch back from.
--   - Only what this player already sees on Bankai Guild's own pages, at no more detail: the Wanted list
--     and its bounties (the Wanted tab's rows), the public rankings (the Slayers boards of the Wanted
--     tab and the signed top three, the donors' top three while the Shogun shows the army the
--     Treasury's ranking (Donors below), the Church's public top three, and each game's ranking the
--     Shogun made public: never a staff view), the player's own frame and title, his own Bankai Guild
--     guild, rank and role, and the leader's presence as the Shogun's lines on the Census and the
--     Realm, his crown and the Realm tab's layer list show it (LeaderPresence below); (1.4.0) and
--     whether a player the game shows him right now is in an Bankai Guild guild (IsBankaiGuildMember below:
--     a live unit token's guild, as the game gives it, and Bankai Guild's own rule). Never the
--     census, another player's private data, the Wanted page's victims or stored sightings, a
--     movement history, a staff view or a secret (a key, sealed channel name, signature or private
--     list). The Board's groups (1.4.0, Groups.lua) as its sections show them: the listings (how many
--     are in a group by class and role, never their names; no time of anyone's), the players
--     looking, and the player's own listing's applications and his own group; on the Shogun's screen
--     the words the Board hides stay out. The optional search returns only a fresh native
--     observation or bounded memory-only recent observation: the target's game-reported unit point
--     when available, its matching group-unit point when it is in the observer's party/raid,
--     otherwise the observer's encounter point. Each row is labelled with that distinction and
--     goes only to the verified request's owner.
--     Each row is built field by field, so what a module adds later never reaches an addon by itself.
--   - Asked, one addon at a time. BankaiGuildAPI.Register("TheirAddon") gives that addon its handle and
--     a line of its own on the privacy page (Consent.lua): explicit, so nothing comes back before
--     its own Yes or the page's clearly labelled Authorize all. The page opens by itself for it once
--     (Consent.Ask). Nothing comes back before
--     the player's Yes, nor after his No; the answer is kept for the account (ns.db.apiAddons) and
--     asked again when what the API gives changes (API.CONSENT_VERSION). Outside an Bankai Guild guild a
--     granted addon learns that the player is in none, and nothing else.
--   - Copies. Every table returned (and each callback's) is built fresh for that call: an addon that
--     changes it changes its own copy, never Bankai Guild's state nor another addon's.
--   - Versioned and pushed: BankaiGuildAPI.VERSION and BankaiGuildAPI.Has(feature) say what this build gives;
--     handle:On(event, fn) tells of a change (WANTED_CHANGED, RANKINGS_CHANGED, PROFILE_CHANGED,
--     GROUPS_CHANGED, LOOKING_CHANGED, MY_GROUP_CHANGED,
--     LEADER_CHANGED, SIGHTING_CHANGED for a search that same handle owns,
--     PROFILE_EFFECT_SESSION_CHANGED for the sanitized host-owned profile session,
--     QUIET_PRESENCE_CHANGED for the quiet presence, and PERMISSION_CHANGED when the player answers), once
--     a burst settles (DISPATCH_DELAY, never in combat), and only when what that
--     call would return changed: nobody needs to poll.
--   - Bounded. RATE_MAX data calls a RATE_WINDOW per addon, MAX_ADDONS addons a session, MAX_CALLBACKS
--     callbacks per event. A callback runs protected: its error is logged with the addon's name
--     (never Bankai Guild's error report) and never stops Bankai Guild or the other callbacks; one that keeps
--     failing (CALLBACK_FAILS) is dropped.
--   - Reserved (Daniel, 2026-10-19: no third-party addon may keep a log of where the Shogun has been).
--     The leader's presence, the sightings searches, the quiet presence and the profile presentation
--     answer only the addons the Bankai Guild team authorized (API.AUTHORIZED: a digest of each one's
--     folded name, so the list names nobody). Any other addon gets "unauthorized" from those methods
--     (RESERVED_METHODS), cannot listen to their events (RESERVED_EVENTS), and its privacy line says
--     only what it may read (API_CONSENT_TEXT_BASIC). BankaiGuildAPI.Has still says what this build has.
-- A handle is the addon's own: Register gives it once a session for a name, to the first caller
-- (a second Register for that name gets nil, "taken"), and only for an addon the game has installed
-- (its TOC's Title, which the privacy line shows). That is a courtesy boundary, not a lock: every
-- addon runs in the same Lua as Bankai Guild and can read its saved variables directly. The API gives
-- honest addons a supported, consented path, so that Bankai Guild itself never hands anything out
-- unasked.
-- Its own file, loaded after the boards it reads (the TOC): a file the TOC adds loads only once the
-- game restarts, so after the update to 1.2.4 BankaiGuildAPI is nil until then (docs/API.md says to
-- check for it). No game event, no frame and no timer of its own while nobody listens.
-- The mods' BankaiGuildBridge (Bridge.lua) is another door, for their companion: unchanged.

-- sources it includes. Every older Yes must be asked again even though the compatible API version
-- stays 1.
-- Version 9 adds the leader's presence (GetLeaderPresence, LEADER_CHANGED) and the wider "outsiders"
-- area scope: what a Yes gives grew, so it is asked again.
-- Version 10 (1.4.0) adds the Board's groups: their reads (the listings, the players looking, the

-- decline, roles, lower) with Bankai Guild's own dialogs opened; and IsBankaiGuildMember (whether a player a
